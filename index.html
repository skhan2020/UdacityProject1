                    Welcome to my winter wonderland! 
                    Growing up in a country with adverse warm climate,
                    I was always been facinated by colder places,
                    particularly where it snows. <br><br>
                    When I first moved to the East coast, it took
                    me time to get used to the winters here,
                    but after a few years it became a second
                    nature. With some fore thinking and organization,
                    I realized that there is much
                    fun to be had during the long cold season. <br><br>
                    Here I will share some of my tricks that
                    will help you tackle this cold season.<br><br><br>
